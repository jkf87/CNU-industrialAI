As part of the program, awardees\\nwere asked to address one of the following \"blue sky\" questions:\\n  * How could/should Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses incorporate ethics\\ninto the curriculum?\\n  * How could we teach AI topics at an early undergraduate or a secondary\\nschool level?\\n  * AI has the potential for broad impact to numerous disciplines. How could we\\nmake AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit\\nnon-engineering fields?\\n  This paper is a collection of their responses, intended to help motivate\\ndiscussion around these issues in AI education.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Eric Eaton</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Sven Koenig</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Claudia Schulz</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Francesco Maurelli</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>John Lee</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Joshua Eckroth</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Mark Crowley</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Richard G.

The concurrent boom of necessary infrastructure, digitized data\\nand general social awareness has propelled massive research and development\\nefforts in the artificial intelligence for education (AIEd) sector. In this\\nreview article, we investigate how artificial intelligence, machine learning\\nand deep learning methods are being utilized to support students, educators and\\nadministrative staff. We do this through the lens of a novel categorization\\napproach. We consider the involvement of AI-driven methods in the education\\nprocess in its entirety - from students admissions, course scheduling etc. in\\nthe proactive planning phase to knowledge delivery, performance assessment etc.\\nin the reactive execution phase. We outline and analyze the major research\\ndirections under proactive and reactive engagement of AI in education using a\\nrepresentative group of 194 original research articles published in the past\\ntwo decades i.e., 2003 - 2022. We discuss the paradigm shifts in the solution\\napproaches proposed, i.e., in the choice of data and algorithms used over this\\ntime. We further dive into how the COVID-19 pandemic challenged and reshaped\\nthe education landscape at the fag end of this time period. Finally, we\\npinpoint existing limitations in adopting artificial intelligence for education\\nand reflect on the path forward.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Sruti Mallik</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Ahana Gangopadhyay</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10231v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10231v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.CY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03869v1</id>\\n    <updated>2022-12-07T17:17:58Z</updated>\\n    <published>2022-12-07T17:17:58Z</published>\\n    <title>Pre-Training With Scientific Text Improves Educational Question\\n  Generation</title>\\n    <summary>  With the boom of digital educational materials and scalable e-learning\\nsystems, the potential for realising AI-assisted personalised learning has\\nskyrocketed.

AGI aims to replicate\\nhuman intelligence through computer systems, which is one of the critical\\ntechnologies having the potential to revolutionize the field of education.\\nCompared to conventional AI models, typically designed for a limited range of\\ntasks, demand significant amounts of domain-specific data for training and may\\nnot always consider intricate interpersonal dynamics in education.

We also provide rich discussions over various ethical issues in\\neducation faced by AGI and how AGI will affect human educators.

However, their educational potential is limited\\nin practice due to three major challenges: i) difficulty in incorporating\\nsymbolic educational knowledge (e.g., causal relationships, and practitioners\\'\\nknowledge) in their development, ii) learning and reflecting biases, and iii)\\nlack of interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education, the\\nintegration of educational knowledge into ANNs becomes crucial for developing\\nAI applications that adhere to essential educational restrictions, and provide\\ninterpretability over the predictions. This research argues that the\\nneural-symbolic family of AI has the potential to address the named challenges.\\nTo this end, it adapts a neural-symbolic AI framework and accordingly develops\\nan approach called NSAI, that injects and extracts educational knowledge into\\nand from deep neural networks, for modelling learners computational thinking.\\nOur findings reveal that the NSAI approach has better generalizability compared\\nto deep neural networks trained merely on training data, as well as training\\ndata augmented by SMOTE and autoencoder methods. More importantly, unlike the\\nother models, the NSAI approach prioritises robust representations that capture\\ncausal relationships between input features and output labels, ensuring safety\\nin learning to avoid spurious correlations and control biases in training data.\\nFurthermore, the NSAI approach enables the extraction of rules from the learned\\nnetwork, facilitating interpretation and reasoning about the path to\\npredictions, as well as refining the initial educational knowledge. These\\nfindings imply that neural-symbolic AI can overcome the limitations of ANNs in\\neducation, enabling trustworthy and interpretable applications.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Danial Hooshyar</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Roger Azevedo</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Yeongwook Yang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00393v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00393v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"I.2.0, I.2.1, I.2.6\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05443v3</id>\\n    <updated>2021-04-11T15:22:14Z</updated>\\n    <published>2020-07-10T15:35:10Z</published>\\n    <title>Algorithmic Fairness in Education</title>\\n    <summary>  Data-driven predictive models are increasingly used in education to support\\nstudents, instructors, and administrators.

AI는 다양한 학문 분야에 광범위한 영향을 미칠 잠재력이 있습니다. 우리는 어떻게 AI 교육을 더 학제간에 만들 수 있을까요, 특히 비공학 분야에 이점을 줄 수 있도록? 이 논문은 AI 교육에 대한 논의를 자극하기 위해 그들의 응답을 모은 것입니다. |\n",
